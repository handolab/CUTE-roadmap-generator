#Roadmap Generator
It is an application to document action plans and export them in a .json file for later use in the Roadmap website.

## Usage
When executing the application, some questions about the action being designed are displayed. Once all the steps are finished, it is saved and the form is blank again to write a new action. You can add all the actions and finally export the .json file with all the information of the actions itinerary (roadmap).
